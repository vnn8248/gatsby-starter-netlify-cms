  description: >-
    Over the past eight years I’ve helped organizations and programs with a
    social or environmental purpose gain more brand visibility and become more
    profitable. I’m especially passionate about building relationships and
    creating content that will help develop local economies and allow for
    innovative educational experiences for all.


    There’s never been a greater need to leverage technology to find novel approaches to issues such as workforce training, educational effectiveness, sustainable development, and community building than now. 


    I’m committed to producing educational content around these conversations. I’m also dedicated to empowering more adults to design careers they love and the world needs!
