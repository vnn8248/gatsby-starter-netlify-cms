### Hi, I'm Jess!

In my view, we work too much not to enjoy and positively contribute to the world with what we do every day. While this has always been my mindset, my focus has continually shifted over the last 12 years as I've experienced what making an impact looks like from the large corporate, small business, government contractor/consultant, non-profit, and online entrepreneur lens. Regardless of what industry or business type I was in, community, culture, and ultimately people were always at the core of making the organization effective. \
\
This is why I'm especially passionate about sustainable, community-based development that provides holistic supports towards economic mobility. I believe creating a lifelong learning culture and shifting how we think about and implement career-based educational programs is at the core of this. \
\
This is why I joined UNC's M.E.I.T.E program focused on educational innovation to contribute towards the shift in education for the future of work that is needed across industries and communities. To support this, I'm open to opportunities to produce educational content and programs for adults that will provide career supports in addition to skill-building opportunities. In doing this, I hope to allow for accessible and innovative educational experiences for all that will also support local economies.
